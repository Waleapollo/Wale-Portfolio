### Project 1: Racial disparity in the UK

In this project I wanted to explore and raise questions on the racial disparity that occurs in the UK and use the power of data to understand where these issues make occur.
I gathered goverment data from various sources regadring this question, explored and visualized it using a variation of graphs.

This dumbbell chart was produced in order to highlight and draw comparison on the disparity and difference in stop and searches between black and white individuals in the United Kingdom. 

Black people are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched by their white counterparts and questions on why and how these figures have occured are due to be raised considering that as an ethnicity black people make up less than 4% of the entire British population.

I produced a Barchart that displays the percentage each ethnic group composition in the police force nationally. With this visualisation it gives us perspective into where the first stepping stone can occur from when creating change.

This multiple plot line graph brings a spotlight on stop and search issues that occur within the UK. 

Does stop and search have a direct impact on the relationship that different ethnic groups have with the police?
