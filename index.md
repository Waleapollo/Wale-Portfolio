This dumbbell chart was produced in order to highlight and draw comparison on the disparity and difference in stop and searches between black and white individuals in the United Kingdom. 

Black people are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched by their white counterparts and questions on why and how these figures have occured are due to be raised considering that as an ethnicity black people make up less than 4% of the entire British population.
