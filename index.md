Below is my Data science portfolio that is filled with independent, self-research projects that I have taken interest in and have great pride in sharing.


### Project 1: Racial disparity in the UK

In this project I wanted to explore and raise questions on the racial disparity that occurs in the UK and use the power of data to understand where these issues may occur.
I gathered goverment data from various sources ( predominantly gov.uk ) regadring this question, explored, wrangled and visualized it using a variation of graphs all within R

This dumbbell chart was produced in order to highlight and draw comparison on the disparity and difference in stop and searches between black and white individuals in the United Kingdom. 

Black people are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched by their white counterparts and questions on why and how these figures have occured are due to be raised considering that as an ethnicity black people make up less than 4% of the entire British population.

I produced a Barchart that displays the percentage each ethnic group composition in the police force nationally. With this visualisation it gives us perspective into where the first stepping stone can occur from when creating change.

This multiple plot line graph brings a spotlight on stop and search issues that occur within the UK. 

Does stop and search have a direct impact on the relationship that different ethnic groups have with the police?



### Conclusion

This project has been of great signficance to me due to it being one of my first independent projects and also based on its personal content. After analysing data regarding the difference in stop and search rates between black and white people there was clear inconsistency in these figures considering that black people consist of 3% of the UK population.

Then I looked into the composition of various ethnic groups in the UK because we must attempt to see if this indirectly or directly can has an affect on the relationships with the public and again disparities were found. Thus with the information and insight that we have gained into this solutions can be draw up from data that has always existed. One solution can be the introduction and diversification of the police force within the UK by introducing more ethnic minorities into these positions. This can have a direct affect on public relations due to the fact that stop and search disproportion will reduce and become more balanced as there is less chance for stereotypes to be enforced.
